For this project, I created a memory card game where the user has to click through a selection of 12 cards without clicking on any card more than once.

Through this project I learned to:

1. Work with custom created React components.
2. Using the useState() hook with different types of variables to create a dynamic front-end user interface.
3. Work with props and passing props through multiple components.

Future enhancements/features to be added:

1. Adding multiple card decks for the user to select from. The user will have the option to select a deck of cards. Then images relating to that deck will be displayed as cards to play with. Example: if the user chooses the pokemon deck, the cards will display 12 pokemon instead of 12 characters from king of the hill.
2. Adding a backend to create a global leaderboard.
3. After creating multiple decks, allowing the user to continue the game by switching decks and combining the scores to get a new high score thats more than 12. 
Example: By playing 3 different decks, the max possible score for a player is 36. The leaderboard will show the highscore + number of decks correctly won!
