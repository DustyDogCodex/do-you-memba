- Sleek slider for viewing cards on mobile screens.

## Future enhancements:

- Adding multiple card decks for the user to select from. Ex:if the user chooses the pokemon deck, the cards will display 12 pokemons.
- Adding a backend to create a global leaderboard.
- After creating multiple decks, allowing the user to continue the game by switching decks and combining the scores to get a new high score thats more than 12. 
Example: By playing 3 different decks, the max possible score for a player is 36. The leaderboard will show the highscore + number of decks correctly won!
